When you try to open the index.html page, you won't see any images, no anchor pages, because you need Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension. Here are some steps to help you get it right:

Step 1:
Install Visual Studio Code.

Step 2:
Open Visual Studio Code and go to the extension window.

Step 3:
Search for Live Server and click the Install button.

Step 4:
Click the Go Live button in the lower right corner.

Step 5:
Now open your browser and type 127.0.0.1:5500/index.html or localhost:5500/index.html in the search/url field.

Step 6:
If your browser indicates that this website may be dangerous, click "Visit Website".

Step 7:
Finished! You see the website with all the images and anchors and pages.

The website is not a virus as it is in your local storage so you will see a local HTML document but when you go to websites where your browser says Warning this page will start an automatic download with a virus the page is not safe and they must return to safety. It's best to go back because a virus isn't good for your data as they take your data and give it back for money.
